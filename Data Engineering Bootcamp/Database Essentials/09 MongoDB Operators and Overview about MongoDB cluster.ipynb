    "As part of this session following topics are covered\n",
    "\n",
    "* CRUD operations in MongoDB – Update,insert and string functions\n",
    "* MongoDB architecture – concepts of Replication and Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRUD operations\n",
    "* Change the case of order_status column\n",
    "<mark>db.orders.aggregate([\n",
    "\n",
    "      {$project : {“order_id” :1,”order_status” : { “$toLower” : “$order_status”}}}</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any row level transformation are done using project and as part of aggregate-we have already covered match, unwind and group in the previous session.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Using Operators***\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different operators with respect to update – updateOne, updateMany and replaceOne\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to update a particular record first verify using find and then update that data in collection\n",
    "* Update a single document example-\n",
    "\n",
    "   <mark>db.orders.updateOne({order_id : 24},{$set : {“$order_status” : ”closed”}})</mark>\n",
    "        \n",
    "   <mark>db.orders.find ({ order_id : 24}).pretty()</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update more than one document example-\n",
    "\n",
    "    db.orders.**updateMany**({order_status :”CLOSED”},{$set :{“$order_status” : “closed”}})\n",
    "\n",
    "***Using Upsert***\n",
    "\n",
    "* If <u>updateOne()</u>, <u>updateMany()</u>, or <u>replaceOne()</u> includes upsert : true **and** no documents match the specified filter, then the operation creates a new document and inserts it. So let us update orders with order_id that doesn’t exist.\n",
    "  <mark>db.orders.updateOne({order_id :68884},{$set :{order_id : 68884, “$order_status”  : “UNKNOWN”}},{upsert: true})</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "* db.orders.count() will increase by one from the previous count as new document got inserted.\n",
    "* db.orders.find({order_id : 68884}) will show the new inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Using Replace***\n",
    "\n",
    "      db.orders.replaceOne({“order_id” : 24},{“order_status” : “UNKNOWN”}\n",
    "      db.orders.find({“order_status” : “UNKNOWN”}).pretty()\n",
    "\n",
    "***Using Delete***\n",
    "\n",
    "       db.orders.deleteMany({order_status:”UNKNOWN”})\n",
    "\n",
    "***Inserting the record***\n",
    "* If you have existing json, you can directly copy that json to insert data.\n",
    "* db.orders.insertOne(\n",
    "   { order_id: 24, order_status: COMPLETE, order_customer_id:30 })\n",
    "\n",
    "***Mongodb string functions***\n",
    "* $concact is used to concatenate any number of strings\n",
    "    \n",
    "* $split splits a string into substrings based on a delimiter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharding and Replication in MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB is a clustered database.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/info-mongodb-com/_com_assets/media/Architecture%20v4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Replication***\n",
    "\n",
    "The replication setting is very much recommended for use in production setting.Replication lets you store copies of data across multiple nodes .This makes data highly available and provides a level of fault tolerance in case a node goes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can also be used to enhance read operations as clients send read and write requests to different servers.\n",
    "* A replica set is a group of Mongod instances.In a replica set one node is primary while others are secondary.\n",
    "* Primary gets all write operations,all data gets replicated from primary to secondary.\n",
    "* When the primary is not  available, the replica set nominates a secondary as the primary and by default, clients read data from the primary\n",
    "\n",
    "***Sharding***\n",
    "* When the volume of data grows huge, sharding in MongoDB provides the data to scale across multiple servers\n",
    "* Shard are used to store data and each shard is a separate replica set in production environment."
