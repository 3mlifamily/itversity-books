    "# Piping output to other commands\n",
    "It is very important to pipe output of command as input to other commands while processing the data. Let us see how we can achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is nothing but a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used in **Linux** and other Unix-like operating systems to send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ls -ltr | rwxrwxrwx        - lists files and directories with full access```\n",
    "\n",
    "```cat filename | less        - shows the last lines of text from the file```\n",

    "```cat filename | grep -i a   - searches for the word a in the file```\n",

    "```grep -v part-00000 | head  - searches top lines in a file```\n",
    "\n",
    "```grep -v part-00000 | wc -l - counts the files in it which is word count```\n",

    "* By default, grep displays the matching lines.\n",

    "**xargs** is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute commands from standard input. It converts input from standard input into arguments to a command. Some commands such as grep and awk can take input either as command-line arguments or from the standard input.\n",

We can extract information from files where data is delimited using cut. Let us see the details related to cut command here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cut command in UNIX is a command line utility for cutting sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output. It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character and delimiter. It can also be used to cut data from file formats like CSV.\n",
    "* Usage: cutting out the sections from each line of files and writing the result to standard output. It can be used to cut parts of a line by byte position, character and field.\n",
    "* Example 1: Write the cut command to get first three characters in the file\n",

    "```cut -d, -f4 orders/part-00000 > order_statuses```\n",
